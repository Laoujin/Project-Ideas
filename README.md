Project Ideas
=============

But who has the time for all that.


TODO:  

aliases: put in yaml and read in $profile  
jekyll check for autoreloading on windows  
Different default shortcuts for making screenshot



Things to do
------------

Some random stuff:  

- Jenkins: have a gem check all urls for 404s?

### Check software

- NimbleText
- OzCode




# Megalomania

Like mega big projects that won't ever be done probably:  

- A WPF app to edit registry, environment variables, ..
- VacationApp? Check: relive.cc en Strava
- International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)


## Chrome extension: DevSearch (or DefSearch)

- take over native F3 / Ctrl+F
- if text is selected on the keyboard, put it in automatically
- have dropdownlist with previous search terms
- search case insensitive, with regex (check how sublime text search looks like)
- highlight found keywords whilst they are being typed
- possibility to put overlay screen at the bottom of the page with all matches with some context
- display how many matches on the page
- jump to the first match right away? when no more matches: clear red indication + stay located at last match
--- double clicking on a match/context jumps to that part of the page (+ highlight that entire section on the screen for a moment)
--- would be great if there was a sublime like part at left to indicate where the matches are located on the page
----- or perhaps that can be done on the vertical scrollbar?
