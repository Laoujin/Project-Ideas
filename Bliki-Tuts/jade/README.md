Sort of static website with Jade
================================
Jade is now called Pug

```
npm init
npm install --save gulp gulp-plumber gulp-jade
touch gulpfile.js
```

Tha plan:
- Check first if something like this does not yet exist in yo
- Import Bootstrap 4 Alpha with Bowerdo 
- do bower and wiredep
- livereload,
