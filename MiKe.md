MIKE
====

move custom-config to userland\config (custom yml & mike.ini)
move custom-example.yml to userland\config
in mike menu "Configure Mi-Ke" --> open wpf app (or electron?)
Bare MiKe: everything should be disabled (except a few things that just make sense?)
Got some Belgium specific things in there now... They should be in separate repositories

Website: the scripts, shortcuts etc should be generated...
--> Once generated, create a link from itenium.be

wpf app:

start screen:  
QUICK SEARCH BAR: Start typing and filter all shortcuts in a grid (with "see source" button)

TILES
--> AVAILABLE SCRIPTS (Activate and configure custom hotkey scripts)
--> CONFIGURE QUICKSTARTERS (Set hotkey shortcuts for your favourite applications)
--> DEVELOPMENT TOOLS (prettify, minify, encode, zip, ...) - Select text or file(s) and perform an operation like base64 encode
--> AUTOHOTKEY DEVELOPMENT (Tools to aid when developing your own custom scripts)
--> MI-KE CONFIG (tray icons, tray tooltip, your editor, your browser, ...)
--> READ THE DOCS (Visit the online docs)

AVAILABLE SCRIPTS
--> take the most interesting scripts (memory compare, ...) and create a small youtube video to demonstrate what it does
--> configure yaml --> write changes in userland\config!


Memory usage: 
Why would I need this?  
- Refactoring example: These two functions look very much alike? But are they (completely) the same?
- Different versions of a document exist side by side. Which one was it that I corrected some mistakes in again?


video: Need to visualize which keys are pressed!





Markdown: Script to autotransform tables instead of doing it manually every time :)
Markdown: I always forget how to create image and link: create snippets?

Free online book:

hotkey to take clipboard and open in editor (write temp file and open in editor?)


# enter some word/text and find all hotkeys matching that
# - need to add "desc" and "tags" fields?
# - shouldn't this be a WPF thingie?



windows 10 vs Mi-Ke:
^#D = new desktop (paint.net)
# + tab = all desktops overview

More Mi-Ke issues:
--> heb op deze laptop ook geen numpad
--> kan geen pasting doen ala control + 1
of dropbox compare met 0


window mover: draw a rectangle in a 12x12 grid and output config to move window to that position



## Configure programs

Tray menu: links to services.msc, processes, scheduler, ...
Direct link to: change time(zone), control panel, ... --> display the default shortcut for those aswell!
See file windows-builtin.yml, everything is listed there
