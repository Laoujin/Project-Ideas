PowerShell JumpLocation
=======================

I've got installed:  
https://github.com/tkellogg/Jump-Location

Don't just take the amount of time spent on a filesystem location but also:  
- long amounts of time without any command... don't count
- more recent events are more important
- command to easily delete directories with a grep
- move no longer existing directories to an archive
- don't automatically store root directories
- direct shortcut for d:\ h:\ ... ctrl+alt+win+d ?
- favorite locations
- blacklist locations
